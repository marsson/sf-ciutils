## üåü What is SF-CIUtils?

SF-CIUtils is a powerful toolkit for Salesforce developers who want to supercharge their CI/CD workflows! This plugin for the Salesforce CLI provides essential utilities that make continuous integration and deployment with Salesforce a breeze.

Think of it as your Swiss Army knife for Salesforce CI/CD operations - whether you're validating repository metadata, monitoring deployments, managing file uploads, or handling user permissions, SF-CIUtils has got you covered!

## ‚ú® Features

- **Validate Repository Metadata**: Compare your local metadata with what's in your org to catch metadata drift
- **Report on Deployments**: Get detailed, real-time information about your deployments
- **Create Files**: Upload files to Salesforce with ease
- **Remove Assignments**: Efficiently manage permission sets, permission set groups, and group assignments

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
sf plugins install @marsson/ciutils
```

Or install a specific version:

```bash
sf plugins install @marsson/ciutils@x.y.z
```

## üîß Commands

### `sf validate repository metadata`

This command helps you validate your local metadata against what's in your Salesforce org. It's like having a detective that spots differences between your local files and what's actually deployed!

```bash
sf validate repository metadata --folder path/to/metadata --target-org your-org
```

**Example**: Check if your local Apex classes match what's in your production org:

```bash
sf validate repository metadata --folder force-app/main/default/classes --target-org production
```

### `sf reporton deployment`

Keep an eye on your deployments with this command. It's like having a deployment dashboard right in your terminal!

```bash
sf reporton deployment --deploymentid 0AfXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX --target-org your-org
```

**Example**: Monitor a deployment and wait for it to complete:

```bash
sf reporton deployment --deploymentid 0AfXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX --target-org production --awaitcompletion
```

### `sf create file`

Upload files to your Salesforce org with this handy command. Perfect for adding documents, images, or any other files to your org!

```bash
sf create file --file path/to/file --target-org your-org
```

**Example**: Upload an image and attach it to a record:

```bash
sf create file --file assets/logo.png --title "Company Logo" --parent-id 001XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX --target-org production
```

### `sf remove assignments`

Efficiently manage user permissions by removing assignments from users. Great for cleaning up access during user offboarding!

```bash
sf remove assignments --object PermissionSet --usernames user@example.com --target-org your-org
```

**Example**: Remove multiple permission sets from multiple users:

```bash
sf remove assignments --object PermissionSet --usernames user1@example.com user2@example.com --target-org production
```
